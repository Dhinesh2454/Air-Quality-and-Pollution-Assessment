# Air-Quality-and-Pollution-Assessment

The dataset you provided contains information about environmental and air quality factors at different locations. Here is an overview of its structure and contents:

1. Columns:
Temperature (°C): The temperature at the given location, measured in degrees Celsius.
Humidity (%): The relative humidity at the given location, measured in percentage.
PM2.5 (µg/m³): Concentration of fine particulate matter (particles with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller) in the air, measured in micrograms per cubic meter.
PM10 (µg/m³): Concentration of particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers or smaller, measured in micrograms per cubic meter.
NO2 (µg/m³): Concentration of nitrogen dioxide in the air, measured in micrograms per cubic meter.
SO2 (µg/m³): Concentration of sulfur dioxide in the air, measured in micrograms per cubic meter.
CO (ppm): Concentration of carbon monoxide in the air, measured in parts per million (ppm).
Proximity to Industrial Areas (km): The distance to the nearest industrial area, measured in kilometers.
Population Density (people/km²): The population density at the location, measured in people per square kilometer.
Air Quality: The overall air quality at the location, classified as Hazardous, Good, Moderate, or Poor based on the various pollution factors.
# Target Variable: Air Quality Levels
To train a machine learning model with the target variable as Air Quality, the goal is to predict the air quality class (Hazardous, Good, Moderate, or Poor) based on the various environmental and air quality features (Temperature, Humidity, PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, Proximity to Industrial Areas, Population Density).
